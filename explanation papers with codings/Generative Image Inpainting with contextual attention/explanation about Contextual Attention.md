Convolutional neural networks process image features with local convolutional kernel layer by layer thus are not effective for borrowing features from distant spatial locations. To overcome the limitation, we consider attention
mechanism and introduce a novel contextual attention layer in the deep generative network. In this section, we first discuss details of the contextual attention layer, and then address how we integrate it into our unified inpainting network.
